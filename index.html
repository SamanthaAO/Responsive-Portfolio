    <h2>About Me</h2>

      <img src="assets/images/profile.jpg" alt="Image of Samantha Orcutt" id="profile_picture">

      <p>I am originally from Los Gatos, California and I now live in sunny Seattle, Washington. I recently graduated cum laude from the University of Washington
        with a degree in Environmental Studies and a minor in Environmental Science and Resource Management. I curreently work for a wealth planning and tax preparation firm
        and a law firm that specializes in probate, estate planning ang guardianship. Through all of this I have learned how important the use of the web and technolgy is 
        whether it is trying to reduce waste outputs to save the environment, or try to get as many clients as possible for your thriving money empire, you need to have an effective,
        visually pleasing, and easily accessible web presence to get the job done. 
      </p>

     <p>For this reason, (and the fact that I am always up for a good challenge) I have decided to persue the all encompassing field of web development. 
       Please peruse my website and view what I have done, and do not hesitate to drop me a line in the contact section.    </p>
